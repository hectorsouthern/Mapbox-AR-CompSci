# Mapbox-AR-CompSci
A fork of the Mapbox-AR repo for my A-Level Computer Science Project.

This project uses world-scale AR technology to allow for the visualisation of large planning project in situ, from anywhere where the construction may be visible.
Terrain data is streamed from Mapbox using their API, and the entire project runs in Unity.
